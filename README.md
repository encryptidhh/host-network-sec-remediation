# Host & Network Security Remediation
One of my favorite projects from my Security+ studies was the Gap Analysis Lab. If you've used CertMaster labs, you're already familiar with it: using PolicyAnalyzer to assess how a Windows Enterprise machine complies with secure baselines and identify areas where its configurations can be improved. This project builds upon that work by incorporating OpenVAS and Nmap for a well-rounded vulnerability assessment, and LGPO.exe to enforce secure Group Policy on an otherwise vulnerable VM.

## How to Use this Repo

As a guide! I used VMware to host my virtual machines, but the tutorial is otherwise vendor-neutral. Here's the virtual machines/materials needed.

Machines: 
* A Windows 10 Enterprise VM
* A Windows Server 2019 VM
* A Kali Linux VM

Software:
* OpenVAS (Kali Linux)
* Nmap (Kali Linux)
* LGPO.exe (Windows 10 Enterprise)
* Security Baselines for the Windows 10 machine version
* PolicyAnalyzer.exe (Windows 10 Enterprise)
