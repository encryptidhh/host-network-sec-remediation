# Host & Network Security Remediation
One of my favorite projects from my Security+ studies was the Gap Analysis Lab. If you've used CertMaster labs, you're already familiar with it: using PolicyAnalyzer to assess how a Windows Enterprise machine complies with secure baselines and identify areas where its configurations can be improved. This project builds upon that work by incorporating OpenVAS and Nmap for a well-rounded vulnerability assessment, and LGPO.exe to enforce secure Group Policy on a vulnerable virtual machine.
